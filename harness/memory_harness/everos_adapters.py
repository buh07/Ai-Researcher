"""EverOS case SearchStore adapter over the accepted reviewed-experience service.

This module is the narrow STEP-04 integration seam that turns the already
accepted EverOS case receipts and ``ReviewedExperienceService`` durable-join
path into one real ``search.SearchStore`` input for
``preparation.PreparationService``, separate from the accepted local
recent/unrepresented evidence store.

A remote case is discovery, never authority.  The store consumes only the
already sanitized bounded-search query it is handed (the exact representation
identity, at most 32 sanitized tokens, and the route of this preparation), asks
``EverOSAdapter.search_case_candidates`` for this exact scope's case
candidates through the accepted public search surface, and then requires the
accepted service to rejoin every hit to its durable confirmed ingestion, case
receipt, reviewed trajectory, and review receipt in the same scope before a
sanitized historical-evidence candidate is derived.  A foreign, malformed,
unconfirmed, altered, unreviewed, or missing receipt omits that one hit and can
never discard an unrelated eligible candidate, and no remote case ever becomes
procedural guidance or a plan.

The store declares ``requires_network=True`` because the case query performs a
real shared/remote task-path call, so the existing preparation gate suppresses
the actual call when ``experience_read`` is disabled or the network mode is
``restricted_local`` while every eligible local store keeps its chance.

The same module carries the narrower EverOS generated-skill procedure
store: one sanitized scoped skill query on the accepted adapter, an exact
match of the durable Step-02 candidate (stable skill id, sanitized content,
exact source case ids, scope, and its sanitized stable metadata), and the
accepted local generated procedure's exact trusted current-candidate path
for the intended recipient.  The remote hit stays discovery provenance
only: it never supplies authority or a ranking score, and it only adds
provenance to the one existing procedure candidate.  The store declares
``requires_network=True`` and ``source_kind="everos_generated_skill"`` so
the accepted gate suppresses the actual call when generated-skill use is
off or the network mode is ``restricted_local``.
