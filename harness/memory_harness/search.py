"""Bounded optional-memory search over the accepted store adapters.

One logical preparation owns one absolute deadline.  Every enabled store gets
a bounded, independent chance to start inside its own sub-budget; a slow,
lazily blocking, or malformed store is isolated and valid completed results
from another store are preserved.  The same deadline covers the complete
consumption of a store's result, normalization, trust gating, scoring, final
deduplication, ranking, and capacity selection, so late values never enter the
packet and a blocked phase returns control at its deadline.  Candidates are normalized and gated
*before* ranking, one logical revision is delivered once no matter how many
stores saw it, and one logical procedure delivers at most one revision: the
narrower authorized scope wins before the discovery score, with the revision
id as the deterministic tie.  Duplicate sightings of one revision merge
their provenance and any ineligible attribution on the narrower eligible
sighting without lending it a score, so no sighting can be boosted by
another.

    """One bounded, enabled optional store adapter.

    ``requires_network`` is the smallest explicit source marker the
    preparation gate needs: it declares that the store's query performs a
    shared/remote task-path call (the shared procedure service), so disabling
    its shared-retrieval feature or selecting ``restricted_local`` must
    suppress the actual call before it begins instead of filtering its output
    afterwards.  Existing caller-supplied stores keep their exact behavior:
    the field defaults to a local store.

    ``source_kind`` is the one additive, finite source marker a purely local
    procedure store needs: the accepted generic ``procedure`` gate cannot tell
    a local curated/builtin store, a local generated-origin store, and a
    shared/remote store apart.  Its documented values are exactly ``caller``
    (the default: every existing caller keeps the accepted generic behavior),
    ``curated_local_procedure`` (a local curated/builtin store that performs no
    shared/remote call, so it stays eligible when shared retrieval and
    generated-skill use are off), and ``generated_local_procedure`` (a local
    generated-origin store that makes no query at all while
    ``generated_skill_use`` is off), and ``everos_generated_skill`` (the future
    EverOS generated-skill procedure store whose query performs a real remote
    call, admitted only while ``generated_skill_use`` is true outside
    ``restricted_local``).  A local procedure source never declares
    ``requires_network``: ``restricted_local`` suppresses only the remote call.
    ``everos_generated_skill`` is the opposite case: the remote call is
    intrinsic to the source, so the marker is rejected unless it also declares
    ``requires_network=True``.

    ``final_proof`` is an optional, separately invoked source-owner readback.
    It receives the selected store/source/logical/revision/content-digest/route
    identity and may return an exact ``frozen_contract`` and/or the distinct
    ``compact_representation`` and ``compact_approval`` records. It must read
    owner state rather than echo candidate fields. Preparation invokes it
    inside the same final cutoff as a live recheck.
