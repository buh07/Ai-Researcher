"""Local SearchStore adapters over the accepted trusted-procedure owner.

This module is the narrow STEP-04 integration seam that turns the already
accepted local trusted-procedure lifecycle into real `search.SearchStore`
inputs for `preparation.PreparationService`.  It adds no second authority: the
accepted `procedures.TrustedProcedureService` keeps owning trusted-issuer
policy, `contracts` keeps owning the procedure, approval, designation,
representation, revocation, and predicate contracts, and the durable
`store.MemoryStore` keeps owning the exact records.  This factory only converts
the durable local current designations that all three owners already validate
into integrity-bound local procedure candidates.

Two stores exist because the product feature contract gates their sources
separately:

- `local-curated-procedures` carries curated and builtin procedure guidance.  It
  performs no shared/remote call, so it stays eligible when remote shared
  retrieval and generated-skill use are off, and `restricted_local` never
  suppresses it.
- `local-generated-procedures` carries generated-origin guidance that retains
  its exact Step-02 candidate, skill approval, source case, and review-receipt
  provenance, plus its own explicit trusted procedure approval and current
  designation.  It is separately gated: while `generated_skill_use` is off the
  preparation gate makes no query at all.

Neither store treats local skill presence, a Step-02 generated-skill approval,
or a semantic hit as delivery approval.  Every delivery resolves one exact
current designation for the intended recipient, and a record that is stale,
withdrawn, revoked, altered, cross-scope, predicate-incompatible,
representationally incomparable, or missing/replacing its durable evidence is
omitted without suppressing any unrelated eligible procedure.

Every store query consumes only the already sanitized bounded-search payload it
is handed, reads the local durable store on the thread the accepted bounded
search hands it, and makes no external call.
