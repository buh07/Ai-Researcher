# Orchestrator Harness v2: Command and Contract Reference

The package exposes one public launcher:

```powershell
python -m orchestrator_harness.operator_launch [--json] {harness,lane,resume-lane,manager,lease,send-lane-notification,scan,watch,view,health}
```

Every public command returns the structured result `{ ok, code, summary, evidence_paths,
next_action }`; `--json` emits the machine-readable result object. Success prints a short status
line and exits 0; failure prints one stable failure code and a message on stderr and exits
non-zero. The harness never schedules work, chooses providers, decides outcomes, accepts
results, operates hardware, or replaces the root orchestrator.

## Command reference

### `harness` — runtime lifecycle

- `harness setup [--overwrite]` — one-time idempotent integration. Validates
  `local-config/harness-config.json` and `local-config/resource-manifest.json`, preflights the
  entire catalog before
  writing anything, stages and byte-verifies the active super-cache, installs the ROOT payloads,
  writes the active resource manifest and lease directory, and starts the persistent monitor.
  It starts no lane or provider and never creates an epoch or worktree. Existing Codex and Claude
  configuration is preserved while harness hook groups are merged idempotently. An existing Codex
  config must already enable hooks. `--overwrite` re-integrates only harness-owned payload files.
- `harness shutdown` — end the whole runtime: OPEN -> SHUTTING_DOWN, each lane's controller cleans
  its own processes, the monitor stops, the active-epoch marker clears, and the runtime closes.
  It never kills by broad process name.

### `lane` — lane lifecycle

- `lane bootstrap --lane-id <id> --provider <id> --model <model>
  [--provider-option NAME=VALUE] [--exclusive-resource <id>] --task-card <path>` — prepare one
  lane: create the worktree, stage the super-cache base and the
  selected provider payload, write the worker binding and inbox/outbox, and open the epoch on
  first use. `--exclusive-resource` may repeat; every name must be declared in
  `resource-manifest.json`.
- `lane launch --lane-id <id>` — start one prepared lane's controller and provider.
- `lane completion-review (--event-id <id> | --lane-id <id>) --review-outcome {PASS,FAIL,BLOCKED}
  --approval {ACCEPTED,REJECTED} --review-summary <text> [--evidence <path>] [--force-accept]
  [--force-reason <text>]` — record ROOT's factual finding and the separate accept/reject
  decision as the linked `COMPLETION_REVIEW.json` / `ORCHESTRATOR_ACCEPTANCE.json` pair outside
  the worktree, and close the managed review event.
- `lane force-stop --lane-id <id>` — hard-stop one stuck lane by exact recorded identity and
  retire it.
- `lane retire --acceptance-ref <path>` — gracefully retire one accepted lane (the reference is
  the `orchestrator-acceptance/v1` record with `approval: ACCEPTED`), cleanup-proof-first and
  archive-first.

### `resume-lane`

- `resume-lane --lane-id <id> --resume-task-card <path> [--rationale <text>]` — re-run a
  stopped, unaccepted lane in its same worktree and provider session with a fresh `run_id`. It
  never reconstructs a session, PID, or worktree.

### `manager` — manager-queue commands (managed only)

- `manager acknowledge --event-id <id>` — move one event PENDING -> ACKNOWLEDGED. Acknowledge
  only the envelope's top-level `event_id` after handling the event; `data.signal_id` is not an
  acknowledgement ID.
- `manager close --event-id <id> --outcome {COMPLETE,BLOCKED} --summary <text>` — close an
  acknowledged event.

### `lease` — orphaned lease recovery

- `lease force-release --resource-id <id>` — release one declared resource only after the exact
  holder is no longer live and current lane/run evidence proves release is safe. The command fails
  closed with a stable `code` and actionable `next_action`; never hand-edit lease records.

### `send-lane-notification`

- `send-lane-notification --lane-id <id> --prompt <text>` — append one assignment to a running
  managed lane's inbox.

### `scan`, `watch`, `view`, `health`

- `scan [--no-write]` — read-only lane-status snapshot.
- `view [--once] [--ascii] [--no-color] [--refresh <seconds>]` — read-only terminal viewer. Each
  lane is one row of seven steps: Recall, Vet, Plan, Pack (from the optional memory handoff; shown
  as skipped for plain lanes), then Work, Review, Learn. Items that need ROOT are listed at the
  bottom with the command to run. `↑`/`↓` select, `enter` shows lane details, `q` quits. It never
  writes runtime records; `--once` (or a non-terminal stdout) prints one snapshot, and `--json`
  adds the collected `state`.
- Optional `"visualizer": "auto" | "off"` in `harness-config.json` (default `off`) opens the
  viewer in a new terminal window or pane (Windows Terminal, Windows console, macOS Terminal,
  tmux, or a Linux terminal): at `harness setup` when already `auto`, and from the monitor when the
  setting changes to `auto`. It is outside the config identity, so changing it never forces a new
  epoch. A live viewer is never opened twice; a host with no terminal gets a `next_action` instead.
- `watch [--until-actionable] [--timeout <duration>] [--until-event <id>]` — block until an
  actionable condition exists (or the named manager event appears). Durations accept `30s`, `5m`,
  `1h`.
- `health reconcile` — rebuild active-lanes and re-derive status (manual entry point to the
  monitor's automatic reconciliation).
- `health monitor-recover` — recover the persistent monitor. Managed coordination only and the
  runtime must be OPEN: starts a missing monitor, restarts a dead one, and force-stops a hung one
  before replacement. A deliberately stopped monitor (stop mark) is never restarted.

## Configuration and one-time integration

Run the public launcher from the `harness-single/` product root. Copy the tracked examples to the
ignored `local-config/harness-config.json` and `local-config/resource-manifest.json` paths before
setup. The config is the closed two-key `harness-config/v1` shape: a required absolute
`root_workspace` and optional `managed_coordination` (`enabled` or `disabled`; default `enabled`).
No other keys are legal. The manifest is the closed `resource-manifest/v1` shape: a literal
`schema` field plus a `resources` list; every nonempty entry declares a nonempty `id` and
`exclusive: true`, and duplicate IDs or unknown fields are invalid. ROOT never passes paths,
feature flags, or a profile again on any later command; the stored config selects everything.

The local pair takes precedence over the legacy same-root pair, which remains readable only for
backwards compatibility; files from the two locations are never mixed. Product-root discovery
does not search parent directories for config, so missing local configuration fails with an exact
copy/setup instruction instead of selecting stale ancestor state.

`managed_coordination: enabled` (managed) stages a manager queue for the epoch: ROOT uses
`manager acknowledge`/`manager close` and `send-lane-notification`, and the monitor promotes
worker notices into the queue. Managed watch wakes from an unresolved queue event or an
actionable lane/resource state and returns the top-level event ID after a durable
per-queue/current-ROOT-session delivery receipt; plain watch has no queue.
`disabled` (plain) omits the manager queue.

## Providers and the adapter catalog

Three provider IDs ship: `codex`, `claude-code`, and `qwen-code`. Each has one tree under
`adapters/<provider-id>/`:

- `root/` — the provider's ROOT payload (config, hooks, binding, eight ROOT skills).
- `super-cache/` — the managed worker payload (worker hooks, config, binding, two worker skills).
- `harness/launcher_binding.py` — the launcher binding, registered under
  `orchestrator_harness/provider_adapters/<provider-id>/` by setup.
- `shipped-machinery/` — adapter-author notes.

`super-cache/custom/` is the custom file-only adapter tree: reserved for local, non-shipped
payload files. The shipped tree keeps only a marker README, and runtime staging never reads it
unless an operator explicitly places payloads there.

## Super-cache and bootstrap

`super-cache/workspace/` is the provider-neutral base staged into every managed worktree by
`lane bootstrap`: the shared `.agent-workspace/` skeleton plus three provider-neutral helpers:

- `result-stop-check.py` — validates the worktree `RESULT.json` against `result/v1` (schema,
  lane/run identity, outcome, summary, evidence, content hash) and exits 0/1.
- `lane-queue.py` — advances one ROOT assignment in the worker inbox (`lane-inbox/v1`) through
  PENDING -> ACKNOWLEDGED -> COMPLETE | BLOCKED.
- `manager-notify.py` — writes one escalation notice into `manager-notifications/` for the
  monitor to promote into the manager queue.

Bootstrap writes the authoritative worker binding with runtime paths into
`.agent-workspace/harness-hook-binding.json`; payload bindings are the static templates the
helpers read. Helpers never write the manager queue; the worker only touches its own inbox and
outbox.

Task cards use the complete `project-task-card/v1` contract: task, base commit, optional branch,
nonempty acceptance criteria and deliverables, and a reason those acceptance fields are
sufficient. Provider preferences are explicit: Codex requires `reasoning_effort` and
`service_tier` (with optional `launcher=ollama`), Claude Code requires `effort`, and Qwen Code
accepts no provider options.

An optional validated `memory_handoff` adds the integrated `memory_harness` preparation path.
Only a ROOT `execution_accepted` plan can produce a dispatch envelope; absent and candidate plans
remain durable, nondispatchable states. Ordinary cards do not create memory state or perform an
optional search. The enhanced path also carries bounded template/search context, privacy and
network decisions, native attempt evidence, and exact terminal/supersession bindings across
review and resume.

## Lane lifecycle and evidence

Lifecycle: task card -> worktree-root `RESULT.json` -> `COMPLETION_REVIEW.json` ->
`ORCHESTRATOR_ACCEPTANCE.json`. The worker writes the result; ROOT records the factual finding
and the separate accept/reject decision with `lane completion-review`. A result is merge-ready
only after schema, lane/run identity, outcome, summary, evidence, and content-hash validation
succeed against the current branch tip in a clean worktree. Reported checks are evidence; the
harness does not execute them.

Stop and cleanup use exact recorded identity (PID plus creation time) only; unknown identity is
never safe absence, and no process is ever killed by broad name or command matching. Static
examples and fixtures are never live provider proof: only a real recorded live run with exact
identity evidence (provider, session, command provenance, delivery receipts) can claim provider
proof.

The monitor records a heartbeat on every pass, including zero watched lanes and promotion or
inspection diagnostics. ROOT PostToolUse records `DELIVERED` receipts without advancing queue
state; hooks only report an unhealthy monitor and direct ROOT to the public
`health monitor-recover` command. Invalid results receive at most five corrective prompts in
the same native provider session; a sixth invalid attempt or a provider startup/auth/process
failure ends as `provider_exited_no_result` without a fresh context.

## Read-only shipped source

The shipped source (`adapters/`, `super-cache/`, `orchestrator_harness/`) is read-only product
material. Launcher bindings are shipped/read-only: setup validates catalog binding bytes against
the registered binding and never copies a binding into product source. Local configuration
belongs under `local-config/`; runtime state lives under the configured root workspace's
`.harness-runtime` with a fresh epoch per live run. Keep source directories free of runtime
output.

## Release checks

`orchestrator_harness.release_checks` is the one stable-ID registry/selector owning fast,
affected, full, and release checks. Credit requires declared-input fingerprints plus exact source
root, Git common directory, and branch identity, with the recorded origin tip still an ancestor
of the current tip; unknown, divergent, mixed, or stale credit is not green evidence.

## Hermetic macOS product demonstration

`python -m unittest orchestrator_harness.tests.test_macos_product_smoke -v` exercises the real
public CLI path from setup through shutdown using a disposable Git repository, sanitized ambient
Git routing/config, empty template/hook directories, and a controlled fake Codex executable. Its
result and transcript evidence is synthetic and is never live-provider proof. This dedicated
macOS demonstration skips on every non-macOS host rather than reporting a cross-platform pass.
