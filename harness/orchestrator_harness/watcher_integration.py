"""Diagnostic watcher compatibility boundary.

The optional watcher can contribute facts to a diagnostic snapshot, but it is
not a second manager attention state machine.  In particular, watcher alerts do
not become harness queue events and acknowledgement is not routed back through
the watcher.  Recovery is a small open/acknowledged/resolved projection only.
