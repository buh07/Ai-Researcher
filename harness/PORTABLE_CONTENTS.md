# Portable contents

Snapshot date: 2026-08-02.

## Included

- Complete production Python code from `orchestrator_harness/`.
- Complete shared `harness_common/` process-identity code.
- Complete production Python code and schema from `harness_watcher_implementation/`.
- Harness and watcher unit/integration tests that are self-contained in this portable tree.
- Example configuration, setup instructions, specifications, attention-logging documentation, and
  testing guides.
- A disposable coding integration fixture with two worktree lanes, one contended named resource,
  stale/valid result paths, a merge lane, native event acknowledgement, and cleanup.
- One static harness configuration fixture required by a copied unit test.

## Deliberately excluded

- `multi-agent-logs/`, `harness_watcher/<epoch>/`, and `fresh-experiments/`.
- Canary state directories, generated JSONL, snapshots, pending notifications, caches, and
  `test_results/`.
- Historical sprint plans, reviews, checkpoints, handoffs, verdicts, and repair prompts.
- The AI watcher-subagent relay model and all collaboration-notification machinery.
- Obsolete owner/watcher wrappers and their repository-history-only test.
- External provider service code and experiment artifacts; they are observed targets, not harness
  or watcher dependencies.

The portable runtime generates new state only under paths selected in local configuration. No
historical runtime evidence was copied into this folder.
