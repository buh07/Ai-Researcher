Shipped adapter tree for the `claude-code` provider.

  declaration), `hooks/post-tool-use.py`,
  `orchestrator-harness-binding.json`, and the eight ROOT skills.
- `super-cache/.claude/` — managed worker payload: worker settings, hook
  declaration, `hooks/orchestrator_harness_post_tool_use.py`,
  `hooks/orchestrator_harness_stop.py`, worker binding, and the two
  worker skills (`manager-notify`, `lane-assignment`).

  (`PROVIDER_ID = "claude-code"`, `ADAPTER_VERSION = "claude-code-v2"`).
